# This produces a container with the Insurgency server already installed. This prevents installation from occuring on every single startup. The tradeoff is a much
# larger (10 GB) container image with copyrighted content, which can't be pushed to public repos (e.g. ghcr.io, dockerhub)

# This produces a Linux container image, but the Insurgency server is actually a Windows x64 binary running under Wine.
# As a result, plugins and mods must be the Windows versions.
# This approach fixes several issues with the Linux version of the Insurgency server, including:
# * The 32-bit Linux server has a memory leak when downloading or checking workshop items, causing it to hit the 4 GB memory limit and crash.
# * The Linux server has undocumented Linux kernel requirements, causing it to crash on some modern kernels (such as those used by default by Talos).

# The Windows x64 version of the Insurgency server runs fine under Wine, but SourceMod has a bug with it (see https://github.com/alliedmodders/sourcemod/issues/2370),
# so the 32-bit version and 32-bit plugins are used instead.
